        <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/stylesheet"
          >stylesheet</a
        >
        language used to describe the presentation of a document written in
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a> or
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XML_introduction"
          >XML</a
        >
        (including XML dialects such as
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</a>,
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML">MathML</a>
        or
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/XHTML"
          >XHTML</a
        >). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper,
        in speech, or on other media.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS is one of the core languages of the <strong>open web</strong> and is
        standardized across browsers according to the
        <a href="http://w3.org/Style/CSS/#specs" target="_blank"
          >W3C specification</a
        >. Developed in levels, CSS1 is now obsolete, CSS2.1 is a
        recommendation, and CSS3, now split into smaller modules, is progressing
        on the standardization track.
      </p>
      <p>
        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present
        the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
        methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
        or
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">screen reader</a
        >), and on
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_display"
          >Braille-based</a
        >
        tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
        content is accessed on a mobile device.
      </p>
      <h2 id="history">History</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        CSS was first proposed by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kon_Wium_Lie"
          >Håkon Wium Lie</a
        >
        on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee"
          >Tim Berners-Lee</a
        >
        at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>. Several other
        style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time,
        and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web
        Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) being
        released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Bos">Bert Bos</a> was
        influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator
        of CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of
        Standard Generalized Markup Language (<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML"
          >SGML</a
        >) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the
        web. One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets
        to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style
        sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other
        hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by
        way of "cascading" styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic
        capabilities to meet the demands of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development"
          >web developers</a
        >. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance,
        at the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in web browser
        implementations, such as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViolaWWW">ViolaWWW</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb">WorldWideWeb</a>,
        made consistent site appearance difficult, and users had less control
        over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim
        Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The
        style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents on the web.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau"
          >Robert Cailliau</a
        >, also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure from the presentation
        so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for
        printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.

      <h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        CSS has a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a> and uses a number of English keywords to specify
        the names of various style properties. A style sheet consists of a list
        of <em>rules</em>. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more <em>selectors</em>, and a
        <em>declaration block</em>.
      </p>
      <h5><strong>Selector</strong></h5>
      <p>
        In CSS, <em>selectors</em> declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
      </p>
      <p>Selectors may apply to the following:
        <ul>
          <li>all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element">elements</a> of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Basic_text">h2</a></li>
          <li>elements specified by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_attribute">attribute</a>, in particular:
            <ul>
              <li><em>id</em>: an identifier unique within the document</li>
              <li><em>class</em>: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">document tree</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to a single element.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Pseudo-classes</em> are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is <code>:hover</code>, which identifies content only when the user “points to” 
        the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in <code>a:hover</code> or <code>#<strong>elementid</strong>:hover</code>. A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a 
        selection that may consist of partial elements, such as <code>::first-line</code> or <code>::first-letter</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
          Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility. Multiple selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination thereof. 
          The order of the selectors is important. For example, <code>div .myClass {color: red;}</code> applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas <code>.myClass div {color: red;}</code> applies to all div elements that are in elements of class myClass.
      </p>
      <p>
          The following table provides a summary of selector syntax indicating usage and the version of CSS that introduced it.
      </p>

        <tr>
          <th>Pattern</th>
          <th>Matches</th>
          <th>First defined in CSS level</th>

        <tr>
          <td>E</td>
          <td>an element of type E</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>E:link</td>
          <td>an E element is the source anchor of a hyperlink of which the target is not yet visited (:link) or already visited (:visited)</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>E:active</td>
          <td>an E element during certain user actions</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>E::first-line</td>
          <td>the first formatted line of an E element</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>E::first-letter</td>
          <td>the first formatted letter of an E element</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
